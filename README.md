gtncldata_peerassessment
========================

The peer assessment project of the Getting and Cleaning Data course by Jeff Leek

The requirements of this project are as follows:
You should create one R script called run_analysis.R that does the following

1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive activity names. 
5. Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject. 

# Contents:

1. final_data.txt - the second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject. 
2. run_analysis.R - the R script which runs the above analysis
3. README.md - overview and instructions to using this repository
4. CodeBook.md - a code book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that was performed to clean up the data

In order to use the script (run_analysis.R) in this repository, open up the script and follow instructions written within.
